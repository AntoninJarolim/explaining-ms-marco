Next, count the number of places that the decimal point must be moved to get back to the original number, which in this case is 5 places. This number will be the exponent on the power of 10.

If the original number were a decimal, the exponent would be negative. For example, 0.059 written in standard form is 5.9 x 10^(-2)."}
