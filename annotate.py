    =========== START OF INSTRUCTIONS ===========

    You will be presented with a query and a passage. 
    Please extract the passage spans that are most relevant to the query.

    For illustration, imagine that you search for the query on Google
    and the passage is one of the results. 
    Which parts of the passage would you like to see highlighted (to get response/most relevant part faster)?
    
    A span must be comprehensive: removing the span from the text should make the text irrelevant to the query.
    A span must be plausible: a human reading only selected span should be convinced that the text is relevant.
    
    Letâ€™s read both the passage and the query, and then carefully consider 
    the relevance of each part of the passage to the query.
    
    You may select multiple spans if needed, but ensure that the selected sections do not overlap. Try not to select entire sentences; prefer fine-grained spans.
    
    Usage:
    Select span using cursor, 
    [Ctrl + C] to copy selected span
    [Ctrl + V] to paste selected span
    [Enter] to submit pasted span and proceed to selection of another
    [Ctrl + D] to submit example and proceed to another example
    [Ctrl + C] to abort the program (restart app to discard progress on current example)
